# Star Wars Character Sheet App

## Objective
To build a cross platform iOS/Android app for creating and maintaining character sheets for Force and Destiny, Edge of the Empire, and Age of Rebellion.

## Steps Taken
I used this project to familiarize myself with the MVVM pattern because Xamarin is built heavily around the pattern. I made a model for characters, and the model is saved to a SQLite database on the device. Through 6 main pages that users can select from, they can edit their characters (Info, Stats, Skills, Talents, Inventory, and Motivations pages). Each page has a viewmodel bound to it for editing the character model.

## The Result
Xamarin Forms uses C# and XAML for building cross platform apps. I had very little experience with C# prior to this project and zero experience with XAML, so it was interesting learning both languages. I also learned about and worked with the MVVM pattern. While it was hard sticking to the pattern at times, the separation of concerns between the models, views, and viewmodels made it easier to work on the project (especially as it grew).
